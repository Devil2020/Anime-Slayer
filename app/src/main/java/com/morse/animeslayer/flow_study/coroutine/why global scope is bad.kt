/*  So Finally GlobalScope bad because

 * A global [CoroutineScope] not bound to any job.
 *
 * Global scope is used to launch top-level coroutines which are operating on the whole application lifetime
 * and are not cancelled prematurely.
 * Another use of the global scope is operators running in [Dispatchers.Unconfined], which don't have any job associated with them.
 *
 * Application code usually should use an application-defined [CoroutineScope]. Using
 * [async][CoroutineScope.async] or [launch][CoroutineScope.launch]
 * on the instance of [GlobalScope] is highly discouraged.

 So the solution to be better Structured concurrency , we can already launch to pre defined scope to manage its jops and join them already .

Summary :-

    if we create a new coroutine scope and then launch it , we must manage their jobs and start join them OR GlobalScope

    if we use structeredConcureeny to lauch new Coroutine , no need for handling their job .
